      Use typeof to Check the Type of a Variable

      Javascript recognizes 7 primitive (immutable - cannot be changed once created) data types.
        - BOOLEAN
        - NULL (explicitly assinged to variable to represent an intentional absence of a value)
        - UNDEFINED (
            - when a var is declared but not assigned a value or a function doesn't return a value. the variable or func result is undefined
            - default value for uninitialized variables
            - also default value for function parameters that are not provided
            - if you try to accessa property that doesn't exist in a object the result is undefined
        )
        - NUMBER
        - STRING
        - SYMBOL (new with es6)
        - BIG INT (nenw with ES2020)

        also one data type for mutable items: OBJECT





      JSON is JavaScript Object Notation

      Use Caution When Reinitializing Variables Inside a Loop

Sometimes it's necessary to save information, increment counters, or re-set variables within a loop. A potential issue is when variables either should be reinitialized, and aren't, or vice versa. This is particularly dangerous if you accidentally reset the variable being used for the terminal condition, causing an infinite loop.

Printing variable values with each cycle of your loop by using console.log() can uncover buggy behavior related to resetting, or failing to reset a variable.

The following function is supposed to create a two-dimensional array with m rows and n columns of zeroes. Unfortunately, it's not producing the expected output because the row variable isn't being reinitialized (set back to an empty array) in the outer loop. Fix the code so it returns a correct 3x2 array of zeroes, which looks like [[0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0]].
Tests

Waiting: Your code should set the matrix variable to an array holding 3 rows of 2 columns of zeroes each.
Waiting: The matrix variable should have 3 rows.
Waiting: The matrix variable should have 2 columns in each row.
Waiting: zeroArray(4,3) should return an array holding 4 rows of 3 columns of zeroes each

//SETUP


function zeroArray(m, n) {
  // Creates a 2-D array with m rows and n columns of zeroes
  let newArray = [];
  let row = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    // Adds the m-th row into newArray

    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      // Pushes n zeroes into the current row to create the columns
      row.push(0);
    }
    // Pushes the current row, which now has n zeroes in it, to the array
    newArray.push(row);
  }
  return newArray;
}

let matrix = zeroArray(3, 2);
console.log(matrix);

      Prevent Infinite Loops with a Valid Terminal Condition

The final topic is the dreaded infinite loop. Loops are great tools when you need your program to run a code block a certain number of times or until a condition is met, but they need a terminal condition that ends the looping. Infinite loops are likely to freeze or crash the browser, and cause general program execution mayhem, which no one wants.

There was an example of an infinite loop in the introduction to this section - it had no terminal condition to break out of the while loop inside loopy(). Do NOT call this function!

function loopy() {
  while(true) {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
  }
}

It's the programmer's job to ensure that the terminal condition, which tells the program when to break out of the loop code, is eventually reached. One error is incrementing or decrementing a counter variable in the wrong direction from the terminal condition. Another one is accidentally resetting a counter or index variable within the loop code, instead of incrementing or decrementing it.

The myFunc() function contains an infinite loop because the terminal condition i != 4 will never evaluate to false (and break the looping) - i will increment by 2 each pass, and jump right over 4 since i is odd to start. Fix the comparison operator in the terminal condition so the loop only runs for i less than or equal to 4.
Tests

Passed: Your code should change the comparison operator in the terminal condition (the middle part) of the for loop.
Passed: Your code should fix the comparison operator in the terminal condition of the loop.


//SETUP

function myFunc() {
  for (let i = 1; i != 4; i += 2) {
    console.log("Still going!");
  }
}
